# Hack The Burgh - VI
# Project - Trading Bot for the Optiver Challenge

The Challenge is to create a trading algorithm to make money by buy and selling stocks on two indeces : S&P500 (SP) and Eurostoxx (ESX). 

Our project is composed of three parts: 

1 - The trading algorithm itself  
2 - An SMS alert functionality to communicate profits and losses  
3 - A web-page for data visualization
